# Gallery Deluxe

A Hugo Module to show a photo gallery. It's very fast/effective, especially if you have lots of images on display.

See the annotated [index.html](exampleSite/layouts/index.html) for a brief explanation about how to set this up. Note that we currently only support 1 gallery per page. **Note** that the `exampleSite` is currently configured to load a [directory from bep's MacBook](https://github.com/bep/gallerydeluxe/blob/main/exampleSite/config.toml#L38). If you want to take this for a spin, modify that so it points to a directory with some JPEGs on your PC.

This theme is what you see on [staticbattery.com](https://staticbattery.com/) which, at the time of writing this, [scores 100](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticbattery.com%2F&form_factor=mobile) at Google PageSpeed for both mobile and desktop.
